## multiplayer game
a multiplayer game that uses vulkan for graphics, tls for networking, packets data are union for data compaction, for multiplayer reliability and fareness maybe try to implument some kind of by frame input calculation so if you click but the other player doesnt but is on a previus frame it will wait for the other player to get to that frame and then check who won or something like that.
use c or zig or some other low level language.
