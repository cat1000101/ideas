# Ideas
## multiplayer game
a multiplayer game that uses vulkan for graphics, tls for networking, packets data are union for data compaction, for multiplayer reliability and fareness maybe try to implument some kind of by frame input calculation so if you click but the other player doesnt but is on a previus frame it will wait for the other player to get to that frame and then check who won or something like that.
use some low level language to learn graphics APIs.
## another multiplayer idea
maybe try to make a multiplayer from scratch, but really from scratch, make my own networking library a client and server that uses those and maybe a database from scratch.
and to make it even better try to use only one language for any components so python for client, zig for networking library, C for the server and rust for the database for example.
## threading impluminitation
using some low level language, make a user land threading or something to that like.
